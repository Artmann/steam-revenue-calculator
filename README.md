## Development

To run your Remix app locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are
installed:

```sh
yarn install
```

Afterwards, start the Remix development server like so:

```sh
yarn run dev
```

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be ready
to go!

If you're used to using the `vercel dev` command provided by
[Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) instead, you can also use that, but it's
not needed.
